# TwoPassword Development Changes

## Phase 1 - Core Foundation (Completed: 2025-08-26)

### Overview
Phase 1 has been successfully completed, establishing the complete foundation for TwoPassword - a secure password manager with Touch ID integration and 2-of-3 recovery system.

### Major Achievements

#### ✅ Project Infrastructure (Task 1)
- **Rust Project Setup**: Complete Cargo project structure with optimized dependencies
- **Development Environment**: Configured clippy, rustfmt, and development tools
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflows for testing, security auditing, and building
- **Environment Configuration**: .env.example and configuration templates
- **Build System**: Release builds successfully generating optimized binaries

#### ✅ Core Cryptographic Foundation (Task 2) 
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Implemented secure vault data encryption
- **Argon2id Key Derivation**: Password-based key derivation with configurable parameters
- **Secure Random Generation**: Cryptographically secure random number generation using ring
- **HMAC Integrity**: SHA-256 HMAC for data integrity verification
- **Memory Safety**: Zeroize integration for secure memory cleanup

#### ✅ Secure Vault System (Task 3)
- **Encrypted Vault Storage**: JSON-based encrypted vault format with metadata
- **Atomic File Operations**: Safe vault saving using temp files and atomic renames
- **Vault Manager**: Complete lifecycle management for vault operations
- **Salt Management**: Proper salt generation, storage, and usage
- **Backup Support**: Vault backup functionality with timestamped files

#### ✅ 2-of-3 Recovery System (Task 4)
- **Shamir's Secret Sharing**: Simplified 2-of-3 secret sharing implementation
- **Three Recovery Methods**:
  1. Simple master password
  2. Touch ID/Passkey authentication
  3. iCloud backup share
- **Recovery Manager**: Unified interface for all recovery scenarios
- **Key Reconstruction**: Any 2 of 3 methods can recover the master secret

#### ✅ Touch ID Integration (Task 5)
- **macOS Support**: Native LocalAuthentication framework integration
- **Cross-Platform**: Graceful fallback on non-macOS platforms
- **Security Context**: Proper security context management and cleanup
- **User Experience**: Clear prompts and error handling for biometric auth

#### ✅ Password Entry Management (Task 6)
- **Entry Operations**: Full CRUD operations for password entries
- **Search Functionality**: Fuzzy search, domain-based search, tag filtering
- **Password Generation**: Configurable secure password generation
- **Entry Validation**: Comprehensive validation for entry data
- **Duplicate Detection**: Smart duplicate entry detection

#### ✅ CLI Interface (Task 7)
- **Complete Command Set**: 
  - `init` - Initialize new vault with interactive password setup
  - `unlock` - Unlock vault with Touch ID fallback
  - `add` - Add entries with password generation options
  - `get` - Search and display entries with password reveal
  - `list` - List entries with filtering options
  - `generate` - Standalone password generation
- **Interactive UX**: Secure password input, confirmation prompts, helpful error messages
- **User-Friendly**: Emoji indicators, progress feedback, and clear instructions

#### ✅ Comprehensive Testing (Task 8)
- **28 Test Cases**: All tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Individual module functionality verification
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-module interaction testing  
- **Cryptographic Tests**: Encryption/decryption roundtrip verification
- **Recovery Tests**: Secret sharing and reconstruction validation

### Technical Specifications

#### Architecture
- **Zero-Knowledge Design**: All encryption performed client-side
- **Modular Structure**: Clean separation of concerns across modules
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with detailed messages
- **Memory Security**: Sensitive data automatically zeroed after use

#### Security Features
- **AES-256-GCM**: Industry-standard authenticated encryption
- **Argon2id**: Memory-hard key derivation function
- **HMAC-SHA256**: Data integrity verification
- **Atomic Operations**: Prevents corruption during vault updates
- **2-of-3 Recovery**: Resilient key recovery without single points of failure

#### Platform Support
- **Primary**: macOS with full Touch ID integration
- **Secondary**: Cross-platform core functionality
- **Requirements**: Rust 1.70+, minimal system dependencies

### Build Artifacts
- **Release Binary**: `target/release/twopassword` (fully functional CLI)
- **Library Crate**: Complete API for future GUI integration
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation and examples

### Test Results
```
running 28 tests
test result: ok. 28 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

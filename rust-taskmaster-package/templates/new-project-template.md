## Development Workflow Files

### `.claude/commands/taskmaster-workflow.md`
```markdown
TaskMaster development workflow helper: $ARGUMENTS

Available workflows:
- "start" - Begin development session with task overview
- "next" - Show next available task  
- "complete X.Y" - Mark task complete and show next
- "status" - Show project progress overview
- "add [description]" - Add new task
- "expand X" - Break down task into subtasks

Steps:
1. Run the requested workflow command
2. Show relevant task information  
3. Provide next step recommendations
4. Update task status if needed
```

### `scripts/dev-workflow.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

case "$1" in
    "start")
        echo "ðŸš€ Development Session Starting..."
        task-master list --status=in-progress
        echo ""
        echo "ðŸ“‹ Next available task:"
        task-master next
        ;;
    "next")
        task-master next
        ;;
    "status")
        echo "ðŸ“Š Project Progress:"
        task-master list
        ;;
    "done")
        if [ -z "$2" ]; then
            echo "Usage: ./scripts/dev-workflow.sh done <task-id>"
            exit 1
        fi
        task-master set-status --id="$2" --status=done
        echo "âœ… Task $2 completed!"
        task-master next
        ;;
    *)
        echo "TaskMaster Development Workflow"
        echo "Usage: ./scripts/dev-workflow.sh [start|next|status|done <id>]"
        ;;
esac
```

Make executable: `chmod +x scripts/dev-workflow.sh`

## Final Checklist

After setup, verify everything works:

- [ ] `task-master --version` shows version
- [ ] `task-master models` shows sonnet configured
- [ ] `.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt` contains your requirements
- [ ] `task-master list` shows generated tasks
- [ ] Claude Code responds to "Show me my current tasks"
- [ ] `./scripts/dev-workflow.sh start` works

## Ready to Code!

You now have a complete TaskMaster setup that can be replicated for any project. The AI will help you stay organized and focused throughout development.

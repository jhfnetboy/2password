			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this enterprise security system into: 1) Cryptographically-signed audit logging with tamper detection, 2) Real-time security dashboard with threat analytics, 3) WebAuthn/FIDO2 hardware key integration, 4) Device fingerprinting and trust management, 5) Emergency access with time-delayed recovery and session management. Each subtask requires deep security expertise and integration with existing authentication systems.",
			"reasoning": "Extremely complex task requiring cryptographic expertise, security protocols, hardware integration, real-time monitoring, and emergency recovery systems. The 5 existing subtasks are appropriately scoped - cryptographic audit logging, security dashboard, hardware authentication, device management, and emergency access each represent significant engineering efforts with different technical domains."
